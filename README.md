![Simple-cv in action](https://i.imgur.com/BPNaV5B.png)

This repository lets one write an academic CV using Markdown. With the
discrete Markdown files and a bit of information provided by `YAML` files, it
generates a CV in both `html` and `pdf` forms that have similar content.
Furthermore, it even allows you to host them on GitHub Pages.

Forked from plain-plain-text.

ToDO:
- tinker with tex2pdf file clearing.
